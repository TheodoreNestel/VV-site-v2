barba uses multiple pages to work 
    -either with a glbal transition that plays each time a page changes or 
    with custom rules that will specify a special type of animation based on conditions 



    barba js cool idea 
    in the enter / exit add the html used for anims 
    directly there then remove it so you dont have to add direct markeup to the htmls 

    you can (and maybe should) do this asyncro 
    so the code has to run before it can move on
